Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy

Heartpress has a zero-tolerance policy toward child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE).

The app strictly prohibits any content, behavior, or activity involving sexual exploitation, abuse, grooming, solicitation, or endangerment of minors. Users must meet the minimum age requirement to use the app.

To prevent and address CSAE, Heartpress implements the following measures:

Enforces age restrictions and removes accounts involving minors

Allows users to report inappropriate content or behavior

Immediately suspends or terminates accounts that violate CSAE policies

Reviews and acts on all CSAE-related reports promptly

Cooperates with law enforcement and relevant authorities when legally required

Any violation of this policy results in permanent account removal and may lead to legal action. Heartpress is committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and secure environment for all users.
